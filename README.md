### React/Rails/Webpack example app ###

This is a very simple app to demonstrate using webpack to create a bundle.js
file that Rails serves.

This allows the entire frontend application to use the CommonJS module format.

The entire frontend application lives under the frontend directory.

More information and JSX coming soon...
